# Constraints Satisfaction Problem for Cross Puzzle
- Minimum Remaining Values
- Least Constraining Value

Minimum Remaining Values (MRV): Choosing the variable with the fewest “legal” values.

Least Constraining Value (LCV): Choosing value that rules out the fewest choices for the neighboring variables in the constraint graph.

Command to run the code:
./xwd [grid file] [grid width]
Example:
./xwd grid5 5
