# Uninformed Search Strategies
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search

Breadth-first search
Breadth-first search is a simple strategy in which the root node is expanded first, then all the successors of the root node are expanded next, then their successors, and so on.

Depth-first search
Depth-first search always expands the deepest node in the current frontier of the search tree.

Command to run the code:
./search [graph file] "[search query]" [index of root node]
Example:
./search t-graph "South Station" 9
